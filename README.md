# Mush-Room

Mush-Room is a fast-paced survival game created using Unreal Engine.

You play as a wizard trying to fight against some disgruntled forest spirits known as “Mushroom Mites”, who are flooding your small home with seemingly invulnerable magical mushrooms. These mushrooms can only be destroyed by tossing them into your cauldron, which contains some unknown magical concoction capable of dissolving them.
